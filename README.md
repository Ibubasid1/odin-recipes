# odin-recipes
First project on TOP
This project requires us to creat a website consisting of different recipes.
The aim is to showcase all the basic HTML skills I have learnt through the TOP curriculum
Since I will only be focusing on the HTML part of the website, the website won't be visually pleasing since I'm focusing on the content instead.
I should be able to write type the boilerplate as well as use headers, paragraphs, strong and em, list elements, links and images.
